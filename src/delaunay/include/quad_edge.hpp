     *
     * The QuadEdge data structure is basically a giant linked list, giving quick access
     * to the primal and dual. In this context the primal is the Delaunay Triangulation while the
     * dual is the Voronoi Diagram. This also makes navigating and modifying the mesh really easy.
     *
     * An Edge is not only represented by its simple origin and destination, but is rather split into
     * 4 half edges, representing the symmetric edge, the dual edge, and the symmetric dual edge, and
     * the edges sharing the same origin. Thus navigating around a vertex or a face is quite simple.
     *
     *
     * A movement in the next direction is always in the counter clockwise direction
     * A movement in the prev direction is always in the clockwise direction.
